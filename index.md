I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, since  Jan 2024 I am a PhD student in the [Symmetric Cryptography](https://informatik.rub.de/symcrypt/) group of [Ruhr Universität Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/), in Germany.
Before that, I was a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/).
I also worked as a part-time lecturer at [Universidad Adolfo Ibañez](https://www.uai.cl/) and PUC. 

My research interests are diverse, including cryptography, logic, integer programming, and social choice. 
I studied mathematics as an undergraduate on  [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/), and did my master studies in computer science guided by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/), and we worked on studying FPRAS algorithms for counting problems on the #P complexity class. Previously, I worked on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation and on combinatorial problems related to blockchains.
