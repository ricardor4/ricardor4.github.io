title: About me
---

I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/).
I was a part-time lecturer at [Universidad Adolfo Ibañez](https://www.uai.cl/) and PUC. 
Now I am a part-time consultant and developer on Blockchain technologies. My interests are mainly Math, Computer Science, Politics and Volunteering.
 


My research interests are diverse, including logic, computational complexity, social choice and cryptography. 
I studied mathematics as an undergraduate on  [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/), and I am a master student in computer science guided by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/), and we are working on studying FPRAS algorithms for counting problems on the #P complexity class. Previously, I worked on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation and on combinatorial problems related to blockchains.

**Starting Jan 2024 I will be a PhD student in the Symmetric Cryptography group of Ruhr Universität Bochum, in Germany.**
