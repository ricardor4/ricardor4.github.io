I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, since  Jan 2024 I am a PhD student in the [Symmetric Cryptography](https://informatik.rub.de/symcrypt/) group of [Ruhr Universität Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/), where I am supervised by [Gregor Leander](https://informatik.rub.de/leander/).
Before that, I was a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/).
I also worked as a part-time lecturer at [Universidad Adolfo Ibañez](https://www.uai.cl/) and PUC. 

My research interests are broad, mainly about cryptanalysis and the use of automated tools for it (SAT/SMT/MILP). Also I have a sweet spot for underanalyzed assumptions in cryptanalysis and fixed-key vs average key behaviours.
Right now I am working on key recovery on differential cryptanalysis and the wrong key randomization hypothesis.   

I studied mathematics as an undergraduate at  [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/), and did a master degree in computer science supervised by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/). With Marcelo we worked on studying FPRAS algorithms for counting problems on the #P complexity class. Previously, we worked on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation and on combinatorial problems related to blockchains.
