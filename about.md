I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/).
I am also a part-time lecturer at [Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez](https://www.uai.cl/) and PUC. My interests are mainly Math, Computer Science, Politics and Volunteering.


My research interests are in graph theory, automata theory, algorithms, and game theory.
I studied mathematics as an undergraduate on  [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/), and I am a master student in computer science guided by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/), and we are working on studying the exact complexity of counting regular path queries in graph databases for some specifics families
 of queries. Previously, I worked on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation and on combinatorial problems related to blockchains.
