I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/). I like Math, Computer Science, Politics and Volunteering.


My research interests are in graph theory, automata theory, logic, and game theory.
I have an undergraduate degree in mathematics from [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and I am a master student in computer science guided by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/), and we are working on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation.
