I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, since  Jan 2024 I am a PhD student in the [Symmetric Cryptography](https://informatik.rub.de/symcrypt/) group of [Ruhr Universität Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/), in Germany.
Before that, I was a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/).
I also worked as a part-time lecturer at [Universidad Adolfo Ibañez](https://www.uai.cl/) and PUC. 

My research interests are diverse, including cryptography, logic, integer programming, and social choice. 

I studied mathematics as an undergraduate at  [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/), and did a master degree in computer science supervised by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/). With Marcelo we worked on studying FPRAS algorithms for counting problems on the #P complexity class. Previously, we worked on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation and on combinatorial problems related to blockchains.


# Non-academic info about me #
I was born in the vibrant city of [Santiago de Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago),  where my father worked as a [travelling salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), so that is maybe the reason why I like theoretical computer science. I enjoy karaoke and consider myself a [Swiftie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift). I'm the type of person who appreciates "Lost in Translation" as a good movie. I have a fondness for dad jokes and am deeply fascinated by the comedic style of [Norm Macdonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GKKnlsZvQA).
