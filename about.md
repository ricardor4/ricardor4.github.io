I am Ricardo Rodriguez Reveco, since  Jan 2024 I am a PhD student in the Symmetric Cryptography group of Ruhr Universität Bochum, in Germany.
Before that, I was a graduate student at [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and [Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/).
I also worked as a part-time lecturer at [Universidad Adolfo Ibañez](https://www.uai.cl/) and PUC. 
 


My research interests are diverse, including cryptography, logic, integer programming, and social choice. 
I studied mathematics as an undergraduate on  [PUC-Chile](https://www.uc.cl/), and did my master studies in computer science guided by Prof. [Marcelo Arenas](http://marceloarenas.cl/), and we worked on studying FPRAS algorithms for counting problems on the #P complexity class. Previously, I worked on a complexity analysis of a formalization of Schelling's model of segregation and on combinatorial problems related to blockchains.


# Some personal stuff #
I was born in the vibrant city of [Santiago de Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago). I enjoy karaoke and consider myself a [Swiftie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift). I'm the type of person who appreciates "Lost in Translation" as a good movie. I have a fondness for dad jokes and am deeply fascinated by the comedic style of [Norm Macdonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GKKnlsZvQA).
